1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

   HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. 
   HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, 
   while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
   HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format, 
   while still maintaining HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers. 
   As opposed to HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

   Objects are one of the most important data types in JavaScript. 
   They are used to store various key collections and more complex entities. 
   Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object literal syntax. 
   For example, we can create an object named myCars with some properties and methods as follows

   JavaScript engines use different ways to represent objects internally. 
   One of the most popular engines is V8, which is developed by Google and used in Chrome and Node.js. 
   V8 uses two modes to represent objects: fast mode and dictionary mode.
